In a Single-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, a single model performs both the retrieval of relevant documents from an external knowledge base and the generation of the final output. This unified architecture simplifies system design and reduces computational and coordination overhead, making it suitable for applications such as basic question answering, summarization, and chatbots. Single-agent RAG systems are easier to deploy and maintain, but their ability to handle complex reasoning or multi-step tasks is limited since all responsibilities lie within a single agent. The lack of specialization can lead to reduced accuracy or performance when handling diverse or domain-specific queries.

On the other hand, a Multi-Agent RAG system distributes the retrieval and generation tasks across multiple specialized agents. For instance, one agent might focus on retrieving documents, another on reasoning or synthesizing information, and yet another on verifying the response. This division of labor enhances the systemâ€™s capacity to tackle complex queries, multi-hop reasoning, and tasks across multiple domains. Multi-agent RAG is modular and scalable, offering improved flexibility and robustness due to the specialized roles of each agent. However, it introduces greater complexity in design and implementation, requires coordination mechanisms, and typically incurs higher computational costs. It is best suited for advanced applications like collaborative AI assistants, scientific research tools, and systems that demand high reasoning accuracy.
